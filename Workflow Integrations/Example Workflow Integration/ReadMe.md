## Workflow Integration Example

This is an Example Workflow Integration Ready to use in Davinci Resolve.
There are plans to keep this updated with versions of Davinci Resolve as they come out.

This plugin is made to be used with Electron's `IPC` workflow with a `Content-Security-Policy`.

Please refer to [these](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/ipc) Docs about Electron and IPC for more context.
Refer to [this](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security) doc about everything you need to know for working with Electron and keeping it secure and safe for the end user.

This is the same Workflow Integration that is created with my VSCode/Sublime Extensions. To find the extension you can search for "Davinci Resolve Toolkit" where ever you find your extensions.
If you want YOUR favorite code editor to have a version of this extension send an email to info@fusionpixelstudio.com.
